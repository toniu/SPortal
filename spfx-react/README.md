## Used SharePoint Framework Version

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.16.1-green.svg)

## Applies to

- [SharePoint Framework](https://aka.ms/spfx)
- [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant)

> If as a developer you are unable to gain administration access into the RHUL SharePoint admin centre then you can get your own free development tenant by subscribing to [Microsoft 365 developer program](http://aka.ms/o365devprogram)
- The main changes would include the change of the email associated with the tenant e.g. for RHUL it is 'zhac'. Any occurence of 'zhac' and '...@live.rhul.ac.uk' in the code for the web parts would need to be changed to your respective tenant; for example your tenant has the email in the form of userXXX@live.[tenant-url].
